title: "Vertical Entry Robot for Navigating Europa"
---

VERNE is a mission concept for Europa subsurface ocean access. It was completed with a team of students, professors, and researchers from Georgia Tech and other institutions. The study comprised of a systems level investigation of the mission (concept of operations illustrated below), as well as an investigation into the systems that would make up a subsurface access probe with the intention of identifying key technology developments.

Frances operated as a systems lead for both the Sample Handling System team and the Structures team, and contributed to the Systems Engineering team. Several technologies that were identified as part of the study became parts of her research and thesis: the tether management system that enables VERNE's profiling, and the Miniature Robotic Electrodialysis system that was identified as key sample processing.
