<p>Outside of research, Frances enjoys volunteering her time at <a href="https://www.chastainhorsepark.org/">Chastain Horse Park</a>, which is a premier accredited PATH center for therapeutic riding and hippotherapy in Atlanta, GA. She has been volunteering her weekends at the horse park since 2017. She has served as a horse leader in lessons (a crucial role to ensure the safety of the therapeutic clients), as well as managed the day-to-day lesson setups and volunteers. In 2021 she was awarded Volunteer of the Year.</p>

<p>Additionally, Frances is a committed runner. While most days she prefers exploring neighborhoods and local parks, in 2022 she completed the Publix Atlanta Marathon in February. They say that a PhD is a marathon, not a sprint!</p>
