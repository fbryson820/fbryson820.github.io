The VERNE project identified a tether managment system to be critical to the exploration of under-ice oceans, particularly those on ocean worlds such as Europa. A mission to access Europaâ€™s ocean will require robust tether management to span across Europaâ€™s thick ice shell as well as to enable ocean activities such as water column profiling. Through-ice deployments tightly constrain the size and mass of the probe to fit within a small borehole diameter; tether management systems of this stringent form factor do not currently exist.

We have designed a tether management system (TMS) that stores up to 950 m of Kevlar-jacketed fiber optic tether within a 15 cm outer diameter. The system has been designed to haul a working load of up to 200 lbs at up to 25 cm/s continuous speed. The system comprises a winch with an independently driven level wind - to maintain even wraps and prevent looping that can be detrimental to a communications tether - as well as a tension decoupling system to reduce the tension in the tether as it is wrapped on the drum.
