I"<p>Astrobiological missions that investigate ocean worlds could encounter high salinity brines. To address complications with salts, we are developing a miniature robotic electrodialysis system to desalt samples with dissolved organic molecule recovery.</p>

<p>To this end, the Miniature Robotic Electrodialysis (MR ED) system has been developed and tested with a number of natural samples, including brines. It has an average dissolved organic carbon recovery of 71% with non-brine samples, and successfully desalted NaCl brines from South Bay Salt Works with 77% DOC recovery.</p>
