I"Õ<p>Frances Bryson is robotics PhD candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Dr. Britney Schmidtâ€™s Planetary Habitability &amp; Technology Lab. Her research and professional interests fall at the intersection of robotics, mechanical engineering, and space exploration. She has contributed to the vehicle and electronics development of ROV Icefin (@icefinrobot), as well as studied custom instrument design for Icefin in the form of a robotic sampling arm to collect solid samples under ice. She has additionally contributed to a mission concept to access Europaâ€™s subsurface ocean (Vertical Entry Robot for Navigating Europa) and continued resulting technology development work in the form of two separate systems; a small-scale tether management system, and a miniaturized desalting system using electrodialysis. She has completed one field season (~2 mo) with ROV Icefin on McMurdo Sound in Antarctica in 2018 and acted as the medical alternate in 2021. Her work at Georgia Tech has combined coursework in mechanics, controls and artificial intelligence with fieldwork, systems engineering and engineering design with a goal of a career in robotics in space exploration, and an interest in exploring the ocean worlds.</p>
